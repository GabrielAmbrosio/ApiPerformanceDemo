## 🎯 Features
- Parallel execution of multiple operations.
- Benchmarking of synchronous vs. asynchronous methods.
- Performance tuning strategies.

## 🔧 Technologies
- .NET 8
- C#
- ASP.NET Core Web API
- BenchmarkDotNet (for performance measurement)
- Dependency Injection
- Async/Await and Task Parallel Library (TPL)
